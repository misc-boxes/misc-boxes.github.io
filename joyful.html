The Annunciation

The first joyful mystery is the Annunciation. The Annunciation focuses on the most elevated creature, Mary the Virgin Mother of God. The angel's greeting to Mary is important, "Hail Mary, full of grace." Mary is being addressed as someone who's able to accept gifts, who's ready to receive. Then, the angel announces to the Maid of Nazareth that she's been chosen to be the Mother of God. Here's what Gabriel says, "Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus. He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of David. His father and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever, and his kingdom will have no end." No first century Israelite would have missed the meaning here. This child shall be the fulfillment of the promise made to King David, and this means that the child is in fact the King of the World, the one who would bring unity and peace to all the nations. The conviction grew upon Israel that this mysterious descendant of David would be king not just for a time and not just in an earthly sense, but forever and for all nations. This definitive king of the Jews would be king of the world. He would be our king as well. As we pray this decade, I invite you to contemplate how you have allowed Jesus to be the king and Lord over your whole life.

“In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the house of David, and the virgin’s name was Mary.” - Luke 1:26-27

Fruit of the mystery: Humility

The Visitation 

The second joyful mystery is the visitation. I've always been fascinated by Mary's haste in the story of her visitation to Elizabeth. Upon hearing the message of Gabriel concerning her own pregnancy and that of her cousin, Mary we hear proceeded in haste into the hill country of Judah to see Elizabeth. Why did she go with such speed and purpose? Because she had found her mission her role in the theo-drama. We are dominated today by the ego drama and all of its ramifications and implications. The ego drama is the play that I'm writing, I'm producing, I'm directing, and above all that I'm starring in. We see this absolutely everywhere in our culture. Freedom of choice reigns supreme. I become the person that I choose to be, but the theo-drama is the great story being told by God, the great play being directed by God. What makes life thrilling is to discover your role in that drama, and this is precisely what happened to Mary. She's found her role, indeed a climactic role, in the theo-drama, and she wants to commune with Elizabeth, who has also discovered her role in that same drama. Throughout this decade of the Rosary, I invite you to contemplate what God reveals to us in the mystery of the visitation. Have you searched for your place in God's story, abandoning the ego drama for the theo-drama with a response as bold and simple as Mary's?

“During those days Mary set out and traveled to the hill country in haste to a town of Judah, where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the infant leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth, filled with the holy Spirit, cried out in a loud voice and said, 'Most blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.'” - Luke 1:39-42

Fruit of the mystery: Love of Neighbor

The Nativity

the third joyful mystery is the nativity when we turn to luke's familiar account of the birth of jesus we see that commences as one would expect poems and histories in the ancient world to commence with the invocation of powerful and important people emperor augustus and quirinius the governor of syria but then luke pulls the rug out from under us for we promptly learn that the story isn't about augustus and quirinius at all but rather about two nobodies making their way from one forgotten outpost of augustus's empire to another when mary and joseph arrived in david city there was no room even at the crude traveler's hostel and so their child is born in a cave where some scholars have recently suggested the lower level of a dwelling the humble part of the house where the animals spent the night luke therefore sets up his story is the tale of two rival emperors caesar the king of the world and jesus the baby king while caesar rules from his palace in rome jesus has no place to lay his head while caesar exercises rangy power jesus is wrapped in swaddling clothes while caesar surrounds himself with wealthy and sophisticated courtiers jesus is surrounded by animals and shepherds of the field and yet the baby king is more powerful than augustus and this is signaled by the presence of an army stratis in the greek of angels in the skies over bethlehem all four of the gospels play out as a struggle culminating in the deadly business of the cross between the worldly powers and the power of christ for jesus is not simply a kindly prophet with a gentle message of forgiveness he's god coming in person to assume command he is the lord the word made flesh as we pray this decade i invite you to contemplate the great mystery of the nativity and the subversive presentation of the arrival of the new king

“In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that the whole world should be enrolled. This was the first enrollment, when Quirinius was governor of Syria. So all went to be enrolled, each to his own town. And Joseph too went up from Galilee from the town of Nazareth to Judea, to the city of David that is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David, to be enrolled with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. While they were there, the time came for her to have her child, and she gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.” - Luke 2:1-7

Fruit of the mystery: Poverty

The Presentation in the Temple

the fourth joyful mystery is the presentation in the temple the importance of this mystery is rooted in the importance of the temple for ancient israel the temple was in practically a literal sense the dwelling place of the lord of all the mountains in the world yahweh preferred mount zion and here he had chosen to live it was the place of encounter par excellence at the temple israel was most itself and most in touch with its mission to bring the worship of the true god to the whole world in the temple divinity and humanity embraced and the human race was brought back online with god whenever someone offered sacrifice in the temple he was turning his mind his life his will back to god he was becoming reconciled that means eyelash to eyelash with the lord but the sins of the nation had according to the prophet ezekiel caused the glory of the lord to depart from the temple therefore one of the deepest aspirations of israel's people was to re-establish the temple as the place of right praise so that the glory of the lord might return we can hear this longing in the prophets in the psalms and in communities like the essenes when joseph and mary bring the infant jesus into the temple therefore we are meant to appreciate that the prophecy of ezekiel is being fulfilled the glory of the lord has returned to his temple as we pray this decade i invite you to contemplate the mystery of the presentation of the infant jesus god with us god here and now with you


“When eight days were completed for his circumcision, he was named Jesus, the name given him by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.

"When the days were completed for their purification according to the law of Moses, they took him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord, just as it is written in the law of the Lord, 'Every male that opens the womb shall be consecrated to the Lord,' and to offer the sacrifice of 'a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons,' in accordance with the dictate in the law of the Lord.” - Luke 2:21-24

Fruit of the mystery: Purity of Heart and Body

The Finding in the Temple

the fifth joyful mystery is the finding in the temple after their visit to jerusalem mary and joseph along with the bevy of their family and friends were heading home to nazareth they presumed that the child jesus was somewhere among his relatives in the caravan instead he was in the temple of the lord conversing with the elders and masters of the law distraught mary and joseph spent three days looking for him any parent who's ever searched for a lost child knows the anguish they must have felt can you imagine what it was like as they tried to sleep at night spitting out the worst scenarios in their mind [Music] when they finally find him they with understandable exasperation upgrade him child why have you treated us like this look your father and i have been searching for you in great anxiety but jesus responds with a kind of devastating lacanism why were you searching for me did you not know that i must be in my father's house the story conveys a truth that runs sharply counter to our sensibilities even the most powerful familial emotions must in the end give way to mission though she felt an enormous pull in the opposite direction mary let her son go allowing him to find his vocation [Music] as we pray the final decade of the rosary i invite you to contemplate the paradox at the heart of this joyful mystery that precisely in the measure that everyone in the family focuses on god's call for one another the family becomes more loving and more peaceful

“Each year his parents went to Jerusalem for the feast of Passover,  and when he was twelve years old, they went up according to festival custom. After they had completed its days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, but his parents did not know it. Thinking that he was in the caravan, they journeyed for a day and looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances, but not finding him, they returned to Jerusalem to look for him. After three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions, and all who heard him were astounded at his understanding and his answers.” - Luke 2:41-47  

Fruit of the mystery: Devotion to Jesus

The Resurrection

the first glorious mystery is the resurrection the resurrection reveals certain definite truths first that jesus having gone all the way down having journeyed into pain despair alienation death itself to the limits of god forsaken us now includes in the divine mercy all those who'd wandered far from god [Music] no matter how far we run from the father we were always running toward the outstretched arms of the sun a second truth is that in our conflicted world christ is not on the side of the scapegoaters but rather on the side of the scapegoated victim the true god does not sanction a community created through violence rather he sanctions what jesus called the kingdom of god a society grounded in forgiveness love and redemption as we pray this first decade i invite you to contemplate how much christ loves us and how his love changes the world 

“But at daybreak on the first day of the week they took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb.They found the stone rolled away from the tomb; but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. While they were puzzling over this, behold, two men in dazzling garments appeared to them. They were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground. They said to them, 'Why do you seek the living one among the dead? He is not here, but he has been raised.'” - Luke 24:1-5

Fruit of the mystery: Faith

<pre style="font-size:1.5em;white-space:pre-wrap;">
The Ascension

the second glorious mystery is the ascension after commissioning his disciples and us to proclaim the gospel to the whole world jesus ascends to heaven where he takes his place at god's right hand how can we even begin to make sense of this mystery and what does it have to do with us when we consider the ascension it's important to understand that jesus has not gone up up and away but rather if i can put it this way more deeply into our world he has gone to a dimension that transcends and yet impinges upon our universe and the prayer of jesus is that the earth will be filled with the glory of god that it will be transformed and elevated according to god's purposes as jesus leaves the scene at least in the most obvious sense he opens the stage for us so that we might act in his name and in accord with his spirit it is precisely those who are most focused on the things of heaven that do most good here below those who pray most intently are most effective in the practical realm this is opened up by the ascension for this decade meditate on the great mystery of jesus bodily ascension which is an invitation for us to go on mission

“So then the Lord Jesus, after he spoke to them, was taken up into heaven and took his seat at the right hand of God.” - Mark 16:19  

Fruit of the mystery: Hope

<pre style="font-size:1.5em;white-space:pre-wrap;">
The Descent of the Holy Spirit

the third glorious mystery is the descent of the holy spirit after jesus ascension the disciples the core of the church are gathered in the upper room where the holy spirit descends upon them the spirit is not a force or a principle but rather a person [Music] that divine person who is the love shared by the father and the son the love that god is from that event eleven timorous and largely uneducated men become fearless evangelists ready and able to spread the gospel far and wide we get some clues as to the nature of the holy spirit from the descriptions offered in the new testament wind and flame the term holy spirit of course just means holy breath spiritual sanctus wind is mysterious blowing where it will coming and going in unpredictable ways when you have the holy spirit in your life you are not in control you cannot command the spirit to come you have to wait for him and pray for him as the disciples are portrayed as doing and once he arrives you have to be ready to move according to his prompting and the spirit is like fire and mind you not just fire but tongues of fire the holy spirit who is nothing but communication between the father and the son inspires fiery speech clear distinct and uncompromising speech on behalf of jesus and this proclamation is public not private the first thing the disciples do once they realize that the fire has fallen upon them is to go out and preach the gospel [Music] as we pray this decade of the rosary i invite you to contemplate the importance of this mystery for the life of the church today and to ponder our mission to continue boldly and publicly to witness to jesus christ

“When the time for Pentecost was fulfilled, they were all in one place together. And suddenly there came from the sky a noise like a strong driving wind, and it filled the entire house in which they were. Then there appeared to them tongues as of fire, which parted and came to rest on each one of them. And they were all filled with the holy Spirit and began to speak in different tongues, as the Spirit enabled them to proclaim.” - Acts 2:1-4

Fruit of the mystery: Wisdom
</pre>

<pre style="font-size:1.5em;white-space:pre-wrap;">
The Assumption

the fourth glorious mystery is the assumption the catechism of the catholic church quoting lumengencium teaches that the immaculate virgin preserved free from all stain of original sin when the course of her earthly life was finished was taken up body and soul into heavenly glory in other words mary is the first participant in the fullness of christ's resurrection in her great magnificat mary is the new isaiah the new jeremiah the new ezekiel for she announces with greatest clarity and joy the coming of the messiah what was only vaguely foreseen in those great prophetic figures is now in clear focus he has shown the strength of his arm he has scattered the proud in their conceit he has filled the hungry with good things and the rich he has sent away empty he has come to the help of a servant israel for he has remembered his promise of mercy the promise that he made to our fathers to abraham and his children forever there is nothing stronger or more beautiful in any of the prophets but mary is more than strong and beautiful she is the sinless one the perfect disciple mary who exists now in this other world is not so much somewhere else as somehow else and this helps to explain why we can speak of her especially in her heavenly state as interceding and praying for us for this decade i invite you to contemplate mary's critical role in salvation history culminating in her bodily assumption which like the ascension of jesus draws us toward a higher world

“Behold, from now on will all ages call me blessed. The Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is his name.” - Luke 1:48-49

Fruit of the mystery: Devotion to Mary
</pre>

<pre style="font-size:1.5em;white-space:pre-wrap;">
The Coronation of Mary

the fifth glorious mystery is the coronation of mary the catechism also teaches us that mary having been assumed body and soul into heaven is exalted by the lord as queen over all things so that she might be more fully conformed to her son the lord of lords and conqueror of sin and death the queenship of mary however is far from a sentimental image one of the great biblical points of reference for the coronation of mary is the 12th chapter of the book of revelation john the visionary sees a great poor tent in heaven a woman clothed with the sun with the moon under her feet and on her head a crown of twelve stars clothed with the sun and with the moon under her feet she's a figure of cosmic significance and power and crowned coronated we know that she is a queen then we discover she's a queen mother for she was crying out in birth pangs in the agony of giving birth next we learn that this cosmic queen mother is also a warrior another poor tent appeared in heaven a great red dragon with seven heads and ten horns the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bear a child so that he might devour her child as soon as it was born what does the red dragon symbolize [Music] rooted in references from psalm 89 from the prophet isaiah and from the book of genesis the red dragon is a sort of summation of all the forces that stand opposed to god and god's creative intention for the human race he stands a thwart the woman and her son after the woman's child is born the sun is snatched away and then a great war breaks out in heaven michael and his angels against the dragon and his angels and the enemy is thrown down what is being portrayed here in beautifully vivid language is the fact that the queen of heaven and her son are the victors in a great cosmic struggle they embody the victory of god over the forces of chaos violence hatred cruelty oppression and injustice as we pray this last decade contemplate the coronation of mary in heaven not as a sentimental ceremony but as a dramatic and subversive mystery the total victory of god in christ

“A great sign appeared in the sky, a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.” - Revelation 12:1

Fruit of the mystery: Grace of a happy death

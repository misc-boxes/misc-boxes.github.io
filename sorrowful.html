The Agony in the Garden

The first sorrowful mystery is the agony in the garden. In the garden of Gethsemane, the son of God enters into the psychological and spiritual space of the sinner. Paul the apostle says Christ became sin; that's his mission, to bring the light and forgiveness of God into the depths of God forsaken us. He's accompanied only by Peter, James, and John, but even those three closest disciples he ultimately leaves behind. He's pressed down to the ground. The great spiritual writers of our tradition interpret this as the sins of the world pressing down upon him, and he sweats blood. Jesus, the very son of God, enters into the state of alienation from God. He feels the suffering of the lost. In that state, he offers an anguished prayer, “Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me.” The whole of Jesus’ life is a battle against the devil, culminating in the Cross. And in the garden, the temptation to avoid following God's will is evident. Yet struggling against every instinct in his body, he demonstrates fortitude, utterly aligning his will to that of the Father, yet“not my will but yours be done.” Here at the very center of the drama, and from the center of the co-inherence of the divine and human wills, comes this prayer that signals trust in the divine providence. As we pray this decade, I invite you to see the aching loneliness of Christ in the garden, as his entry into the psychological and spiritual space of the sinner, and to see his great prayer in the garden as a guide for our own prayers and a key to lasting joy and peace, “not my will but yours be done.”

“Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, 'Sit here while I go over there and pray.' He took along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to feel sorrow and distress. Then he said to them, 'My soul is sorrowful even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me.' He advanced a little and fell prostrate in prayer, saying, 'My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet, not as I will, but as you will.'” - Matthew 26:36-39

Fruit of the mystery: Obedience to God’s Will

The Scourging at the Pillar

The second sorrowful mystery is the scourging at the pillar. After Pilate sentences Jesus to death, he has Jesus scourged at the pillar, which was a customary torture leading up to crucifixion. We know from archaeological evidence and from written accounts what this form of punishment was like. Using a variety of weapons and instruments, Roman scourgers would brutalize their victims. Von Balthazar writes that even those passive aspects of Jesus’ passion, in which he allows himself to be used, including the scourging at the pillar, are expressions of his active will to give himself up in self-surrender, a loving completion of God's promise to his people. Presenting the scourged Jesus to the crowds, Pilate says, “Behold the man.” In the delicious irony of John's Gospel, Pilate is unwittingly drawing attention to the fact that Jesus, completely acquiescent to the will of his father, even to the point of accepting torture and death, is in fact the man, humanity at its fullest and most free. Throughout this decade of the Rosary, I invite you to contemplate the brutality endured by Christ during his scourging and to see his acceptance of suffering as the means through which he conquers sin and redeems humanity. 

“Then he released Barabbas to them, but after he had Jesus scourged, he handed him over to be crucified.” - Matthew 27:26

The Crowning with Thorns

The third sorrowful mystery is the crowning with thorns. Upon being presented to Pilate, Jesus is asked, “Are you the king of the Jews?” A blandly affirmative answer comes, “You say so.” This leads the Roman soldiers to place a purple military cloak on his shoulders, a reed in his right hand, and a crown of thorns on his head. They say, “Hail, king of the Jews,” and they further mock him by kneeling before him, spitting on him, and striking him on the head with the reed. But Mark's Gospel does not want us to miss the irony that, precisely as the king of the Jews and the son of David, Jesus is implicitly king to those soldiers, for the mission of the Davidic king is the unification not only of the tribes of Israel but also of the tribes of all the world. In a meditation he wrote on this mystery, Fulton Sheen calls this mockery of the true king by the soldiers who presume Jesus’ kingship to be false an atonement for the sins of the mind such as egotism, doubt, and pride. The key to honor in the kingdom of God is the willingness to suffer out of love to give one's life away as a gift. Look at the lives of the saints; it's never about aggrandizing the ego but rather emptying it out. For this decade, I invite you to savor the way that Christ absorbs the mockery and hatred of the crowd and thereby reveals the quality of the divine forgiveness and love.

“Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus inside the praetorium and gathered the whole cohort around him. They stripped off his clothes and threw a scarlet military cloak about him. Weaving a crown out of thorns, they placed it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, 'Hail, King of the Jews!'” - Matthew 27:27-29

The Carrying of the Cross

The fourth sorrowful mystery is the carrying of the cross. Carrying the cross must become the very structure of the Christian life. Jesus said, “whoever does not take up his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me.” This saying must have been gut-wrenching to his first century audience for they knew what the cross meant. It meant a death and utter agony, nakedness, and humiliation. They didn't think of the cross automatically in religious terms as we do, for they knew it in all of its awful power, yet Jesus places this terrible image at the very center of the spiritual life. How should we take up our own cross? We do so by being willing to suffer as Jesus did. We carry our cross and imitation of Christ loving what he loved, despising what he despised. If God is willing to break open his own heart, then we must be willing to break open our hearts for others. Jesus bore the burdens of the whole world, and this is what we must do actively, proactively, seeking out ways to lighten other people's loads. As we pray this decade of the Rosary, I invite you to contemplate the centrality of this journey of self-sacrifice in the Christian life.

“They pressed into service a passer-by, Simon, a Cyrenian, who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross. They brought him to the place of Golgotha (which is translated Place of the Skull).” - Mark 15:21-22

The Crucifixion and Death

The fifth sorrowful mystery is the Crucifixion and death of Jesus. Christians have become so accustomed to seeing the crucifix in churches and schools, on seasonal greeting cards, or worn as jewelry around people's necks, that they've lost any sense of how awful and strange it was but to the first Christians. The cross of Christ was that and more. Paul called it a stumbling block to the Jews and foolishness to gentiles, insinuating that it was sure to bother just about everybody. For the first several centuries of Christianity, artists were reluctant to depict the death of the Lord because it was just too terrible. and yet Paul can say we proclaim Christ crucified. And the entire Christian tradition, from Augustine to Francis of Assisi, to Dante, to Ignatius Loyola, to Trappist monks in the hills of Kentucky, has echoed him. Somehow they knew that writhing figure pinned to his cross is the whole story. What is that story? The crucifixion of Jesus is God's judgment on the world and the fullest expression of the divine anger at sin. We are meant to see on that cross not simply a violent display but rather our own ugliness. What brought Jesus to the cross? Stupidity, anger, mistrust, institutional injustice, betrayal of friends, denial, unspeakable cruelty, scapegoating, fear. In other words, all of our dysfunction is revealed on that cross. In the light of the cross, no one can honestly say I'm okay and you're okay. In the tormented face of Christ crucified, we know that something has gone terribly wrong with God's creation, that we are like prisoners chained inside of an escape-proof prison, that we are at war with ourselves. Does this mean that God the father is a cruel taskmaster demanding a bloody sacrifice to appease his anger? No, because we also see something else in the brutality of the cross. We see that God himself has come to stand with us shoulder to shoulder in our dysfunction. Jesus’ crucifixion was the opening up of the divine heart so that we could see that no sin of ours could finally separate us from the love of God. As we pray this final decade, I invite you to savor the strange beauty and the mystery of the crucified Son of God.

“When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him and the criminals there, one on his right, the other on his left. [Then Jesus said, 'Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.'] They divided his garments by casting lots. The people stood by and watched; the rulers, meanwhile, sneered at him and said, 'He saved others, let him save himself if he is the chosen one, the Messiah of God.' Even the soldiers jeered at him. As they approached to offer him wine they called out, 'If you are King of the Jews, save yourself.' Above him there was an inscription that read, 'This is the King of the Jews.' Now one of the criminals hanging there reviled Jesus, saying, 'Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us.' The other, however, rebuking him, said in reply, 'Have you no fear of God, for you are subject to the same condemnation? And indeed, we have been condemned justly, for the sentence we received corresponds to our crimes, but this man has done nothing criminal.' Then he said, 'Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.' He replied to him, 'Amen, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.'

"It was now about noon and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon because of an eclipse of the sun. Then the veil of the temple was torn down the middle. Jesus cried out in a loud voice, 'Father, into your hands I commend my spirit'; and when he had said this he breathed his last.” - Luke 23:33-46

Hail, Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy, our life, our sweetness and our hope. To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve; to thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears. Turn then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us; and after this, our exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.  Pray for us, O holy Mother of God, so that we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.

Amen.

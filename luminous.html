The Baptism of Christ in the Jordan

the first luminous mystery is the baptism of christ in the jordan how strange and scandalous seems the baptism of jesus christ the lord the messiah the son of god the sinless lamb who takes away the sins of the world receives for himself the baptism of john a baptism of repentance why is jesus seeking a baptism of repentance the difficulty is reflected in the baptist's confusion i should be baptized by you and yet you come to me it cannot be true that the lord jesus is a sinner because if this is true all of christian revelation is undermined as is usually the case with the bible what we have here is a startling surprise before ever a word passes jesus lips he is presenting his mission in this gesture god lays aside his glory and humbly joins us in the muddy waters of our sinfulness though sinless christ stands with us though we are sinners christ does not remain aloof but immerses himself fully in all that it means to be human jesus says to john give in for now we must do this to fulfill all righteousness fulfilling righteousness in the old dispensation would have meant something like doing what god wants or getting right with god yet god in christ takes this step further now we see that all righteousness has to do with god's setting things right with us and for us by humbly standing with the sinners he means to save as we pray this first decade i invite you to contemplate your own baptism which unites you to the lamb of god who takes away the sins of the world


“After Jesus was baptized, he came up from the water and behold, the heavens were opened [for him], and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove [and] coming upon him. And a voice came from the heavens, saying, 'This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.'” - Matthew 3:16-17

Fruit of the mystery: Openness to the Holy Spirit

The Wedding Feast at Cana

the second luminous mystery is the wedding feast at cana weddings are a consistent biblical symbol for the mystical union between god and his people god wants to marry his people israel because he loves them so passionately he wants to fill them with his own life consummating the marriage if you will now what is the fulfillment of this prophecy nothing other than the incarnation when a divine nature and a human nature came together in the unity of a divine person to form a marriage between god and israel jesus is the wedding of heaven and earth the marriage of divinity and humanity he is the bridegroom and the church is the bride in him the most intimate union is achieved between god and the world at this wedding jesus changes 180 gallons of water into the wine of the divine life an intoxication of grace when we are infused with the divine life when we are married to god life never runs out for this decade let us consider the great mystery of christ's own wedding feast the abundance of divine grace coming to israel and all of humanity through the incarnation

“On the third day there was a wedding in Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding. When the wine ran short, the mother of Jesus said to him, 'They have no wine.' [And] Jesus said to her, 'Woman, how does your concern affect me? My hour has not yet come.' His mother said to the servers, 'Do whatever he tells you.'” - John 2:1-5

Fruit of the mystery: To Jesus through Mary

Jesus' Proclamation of the Coming of the Kingdom of God

the third luminous mystery is jesus proclamation of the coming of the kingdom of god the first words out of the mouth of jesus in the gospel of mark are a call to conversion the kingdom of god has come near repent and believe in the good news let's take a closer look at the invitation christ places on offer first repent notice that the life preaching and mission of jesus are predicated upon the assumption that all is not well with us a salvation religion makes no sense if we're all basically fine if all we need is a little sprucing up around the edges christian saints are those who can bear the awful revelation that sin is not simply an abstraction or something that other people wrestle with but a power that lurks and works in them second believe the good news something here is being brought to completion what is it it is the story of israel itself jesus fulfills in his person the entirety of the old testament and this is why his presence is so compelling and why following him is of paramount importance the good news is he himself and his time to make a decision when jesus calls we have to respond the time is now  as we pray this decade contemplate jesus proclamation of the coming of the kingdom of god as the inbreaking of a new world one that commands us to change our way of thinking and acting

“'This is the time of fulfillment. The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel.'” - Mark 1:15  

Fruit of the mystery: Conversion

The Transfiguration

the fourth luminous mystery is the transfiguration jesus goes up the mountain with peter james and john this seemingly ordinary man from nazareth this brother of theirs this fellow israelite is then transfigured before them his face shining like the sun his clothes becoming white as light the greek term behind our word transfiguration is metamorphic to go beyond the form that you have [Music] the metamorphosis of a caterpillar comes to mind this ordinary jesus and there's no indication they've lost sight of who he was somehow became transformed elevated enhanced in his manner of being the first thing we notice is that his appearance became more beautiful one of the classical features of beauty is claritas or radiance so his face shone his clothes became white as light the proximity of his divinity in no way compromises the integrity of his humanity but rather makes it shine in greater beauty these somewhat grubby bodies of ours whose beauty lasts for a fleeting moment are destined for a transfigured elevated beauty secondly in his transfigured state jesus transcends space and time since he's pictured talking with moses and elijah figures representing the law and the prophets of the old testament in this world we are caught in one moment of space and time but in heaven we will live in the eternal now of god's life a higher richer more beautiful and spiritually fulfilling life awaits us for this decade think about how the mystery of the transfiguration doesn't just reveal who christ is it reveals who we sinners are called to become eternal sons and daughters of the living god

“After six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. And he was transfigured before them; his face shone like the sun and his clothes became white as light.” - Matthew 17:1-2

Fruit of the mystery: Desire for holiness
</pre>

<pre style="font-size:1.5em;white-space:pre-wrap>
The Institution of the Eucharist

the fifth luminous mystery is the institution of the eucharist jesus asked his disciples to go into jerusalem and prepare a passover supper the eucharist is first the great meal of fellowship that god wants to establish with his people the joyful bond which the divine life is shared spiritually and physically with a hungry world however in a fallen world this communion is impossible without sacrifice at the heart of the passover meal was the eating of a sacrificed lamb in remembrance of the lambs of the original passover whose blood had been smeared on the doorposts of the israelites in egypt making his last supper a passover meal jesus was signaling the fulfillment of john the baptist prophecy that he jesus would be the definitive lamb of god this emphasis becomes even clearer when we meditate on the image of the disciples drinking the blood of jesus from a cup when someone came to the temple to offer sacrifice he would cut the throat of the animal and a priest would catch the victim's blood in a cup before carrying it for the offering the implication is clear jesus is referring to his own blood being shed for the forgiveness of sins  after blessing and breaking the unleavened bread of the passover meal jesus pronounced these words take and eat this is my body the central claim of the catholic church is that jesus is substantially present under the forms of bread and wine and that this definitive sacrifice is made sacramentally present at every mass his presence is not simply evocative and symbolic but rather real true substantial if jesus were simply an ordinary human being his words would have at best a symbolic resonance but jesus is god and what god says is as we pray this final decade meditate on christ's institution of the eucharist as a great meal of fellowship the definitive sacrifice and the real presence under the forms of bread and wine the eucharist is the lord jesus himself

“While they were eating, Jesus took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and giving it to his disciples said, 'Take and eat; this is my body.'” - Matthew 26:26  

Fruit of the mystery: Adoration
